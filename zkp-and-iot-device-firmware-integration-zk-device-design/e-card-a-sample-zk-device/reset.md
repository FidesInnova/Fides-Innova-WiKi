#### Reset Instructions for the Sensor E-Card

To reset your sensor E-card, please follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Reset Push-Button and LED Indicator**:
   * Identify the reset push-button and the LED indicator on your E-card. The reset push-button is typically a small, tactile button, and the LED is usually nearby.
2. **Initial Button Press**:
   * Press and hold the reset push-button on the E-card.
   * Keep holding the button until you observe the LED on the E-card flashing rapidly. This indicates that the E-card is preparing for the reset process.
3. **Hold for 10 Seconds**:
   * Once the LED starts flashing rapidly, continue to hold the push-button for an additional 10 seconds.
   * Do not release the button during this period, as doing so will interrupt the reset process.
4. **Release the Button**:
   * After holding the push-button for 10 seconds, release it.
   * The LED may flash or change its pattern to indicate that the reset process is complete.
5. **Confirmation**:
   * Wait a few moments for the E-card to complete its reset cycle.
   * The E-card should now be reset to its default settings. You may observe the LED returning to a steady state or another pattern indicating normal operation.

#### Notes:

* Ensure that the E-card is powered on during the reset process.
* If the reset does not seem to work, repeat the process carefully, ensuring each step is followed precisely.

By following these steps, your sensor E-card should be successfully reset.
