# Full Node

A FidesInnova full node consists of three servers: an **IoT server**, a **general node**, and a **validator node**.&#x20;

The IoT server manages devices and users, the general node bridges the IoT server to the decentralized IoT network, and the validator node generates blocks and helps manage the decentralized network.\
